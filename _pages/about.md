Welcome to my page!
======
I am a fourth-year statistics PhD student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research focuses both on cell image segmentation methodologies and analytically determining how to control cell alignment and proliferation via experimental starting parameters (such as substrate and seeding cell density). Outside of school, I enjoy hanging out with my dog and volunteering with a sea lion and seal rehabilitation center!

I am currently searching for an internship for Summer 2024. Although my research experience is largely in biostatistics, I am open to all types of positions and would be excited to work with new data types and analysis techniques. If you or your organization has opportunities aligning with my skills and interests, please email me at blytheking[at]ucsb.edu.
