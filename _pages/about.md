Welcome to my page!
======
I am a fourth-year statistics PhD student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research focuses both on cell image segmentation methodologies and analytically determining how to control cell alignment and proliferation via experimental starting parameters (such as substrate and seeding cell density). Outside of school, I enjoy hanging out with my dog and volunteering with a sea lion and seal rehabilitation center!
