I am a sixth-year statistics PhD candidate at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research focuses on cell image segmentation methodologies, and I have internship experience analyzing clinical datasets and real-world data. I am currently working as a Machine Learning Data Scientist focusing on precision medicine models in acute care. Outside of school, I enjoy hanging out with my dog and volunteering with a sea lion and seal rehabilitation center!
