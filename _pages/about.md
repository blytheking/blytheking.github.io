Welcome to my page!
======
I am a sixth-year statistics PhD student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research focuses on cell image segmentation methodologies, and I have internship experience analyzing clinical datasets. Outside of school, I enjoy hanging out with my dog and volunteering with a sea lion and seal rehabilitation center!

As I approach graduation, I am looking for a role that will not only allow me to leverage my current skillset but also introduce me to new methodologies and interdisciplinary challenges. I am particularly interested in quantitative roles in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. However, I am open to all industries, and I would be excited to take on new opportunities and can adapt quickly to new environments. If you or your organization has opportunities aligning with my skills and interests, please email me at blytheking[at]ucsb.edu.
