Welcome to my page!
======
I am a fifth-year statistics PhD student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research focuses on cell image segmentation methodologies, and I have internship experience analyzing clinical datasets. Outside of school, I enjoy hanging out with my dog and volunteering with a sea lion and seal rehabilitation center!

If you or your organization has opportunities aligning with my skills and interests, please email me at blytheking[at]ucsb.edu.
